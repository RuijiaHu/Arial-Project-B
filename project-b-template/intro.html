                This is a collection of different characters in four levels of social hierarchies.
            </p>

            <p>
                The top-class presents a royal family.
                Everybody is having great fun and there is no need to worry about anything. The furnitures are
                luxurious, the dishes are delicate, the clothes are decorated by jewelies, the wine is well brewed, etc.
                Cashes surround them, mansions lived them... They could reach the best resource and the best quality of
                life.
            </p>

            <p>
                The upper-class contains well-off people who have power and money, they are ministers who are receiving
                bribes, the rich seconds who are enjoying their lives, gangs who unbridledly use underground power,
                monopoly capitalists who leisurely hold his cigar, etc. Because of the wealth, they may do whatever they
                want, eat whatever they want, go wherever they want to enjoy their life. This is unreachable for people
                who are unable to get to economic independence.
            </p>

            <p>
                The middle-class is closer to our daily life and we can find their shadows on each one of us. The bank
                clerks, the chefs, the teachers, the guards, etc. They are who we familiar with.</p>

            <p>
                The low-class displays the people who are living at the bottom of our society. The one sleeps alongside
                the street or under the bridges, the one lives in the slum, the one bagging on the road, the one picking
                up
                the bottles and garbages, etc. We can witness their poverty and hunger and unsheltered, but what can we
                do?
                This is really what we should think about to improve our society!
            </p>

            <p>
                However, live a healthy and happy life is what we should do. For social justice, we need to maintain
                kindness inside everyone and with the effort of everyone, we may be in the harmony.
